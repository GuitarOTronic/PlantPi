Harvest buds while they’re tight and firm and hopefully at least 3 inches in diameter; if buds begin to open, they lose their tenderness. Fully open buds are inedible but produce striking, large, lavender flowers. Cut a 1- to 3-inch section of stem with each bud to make it easier to handle. The lower buds that develop later won’t grow as large as the top bud. When you have harvested all buds on a stem, cut the stem to the ground.

If you harvest the pods while they are a little thinner than the average finger, you can cook them pod and all. After that, the pods get too tough to eat and they become shelling beans. In addition to removing the pods, fava beans have a thick skin or membrane that also needs to be removed before cooking. You can usually just pop them out of their skins, but it can be time-consuming if you're doing a lot. Shelled beans can be used immediately, stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days, or frozen for later use. Cooked beans can get dried out in the refrigerator.

Carrots taste much better after one or more frosts. (A frost encourages the plant to start storing energy—sugars—in its root for later use.) Following the first hard frost in the fall, cover carrot tops with an 18-inch layer of shredded leaves to preserve them for harvesting later. Note: Carrots are biennial.
